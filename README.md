COART projetc whitepaper

***Abstract.*** *COART is the open source Platform for art investment; online art fair for sale of different art; special technical algorithm for tokenization, identification and art-asset management, based on EOSIO-software. We are introducing a new approach to global Art market for collectors, art dealers, gallery owners, art experts, auction houses, museums, investment funds, retail investors and traders.*

### 1. Executive summary
***1.1 What’s the value of COART? Who are the target Audience?***

COART lowers the barriers for retail investors to invest in art assets using co-investment. Currently, investment in high-end artworks (valued at $1 M and above) are prohibitively high amount, so only wealthy collectors, family o ices, and investment funds can a ord to do so.

COART proposes a special mechanism using blockchain technology that lowers the barriers to entry for retail investors and traders who have an interest in investing in art, but at lower capital entry requirements. Moreover, COART represents something else, something broader.

Participants of the Art market know that the existing system objectively does not correspond to the present needs, it is not transparent and too enclosed, what makes access to the art market di icult for the new artists and those who are interested in investing in art-assets. We are going to create the new and equal opportunities for all participants of the Art market, from artists to investors.

We are building a new specialized Collaborative Art (**COART**) blockchain infrastructure, a platform for launching hundreds of new projects in all segments of the Art market. Artists and art dealers who represent them will have a direct access to the global art market for self-sale of their works, or will be able to raise funds for the creation of new works.

Gallery owners and museums will get a new way to raise funds for their needs, it will be much more convenient when compared to all the existing opportunities. Auction houses and investment Art Funds will receive new customers - retail investors and traders, to whom direct access to the art market will be provided by COART. In fact, all participants of the Art market are the Target Audience of COART.

***1.2 How can we do it and why do we need blockchain for it?***

The COART ecosystem based on EOSIO software has its own system token called BID.
Provenance distributed ledger, containing all known data on the history of ownership and exposure of speci c art objects, decentralized art-original and digital-original data distributed storage, security tokens of art assets (ART-ASSET tokens), integrated payment subsystem, special ART-ASSET tokens exchange, stable/tethered coin mechanics and liquidity provider subsystem creating easy entry point for all the di erent art market stakeholders are also going to be implemented on EOSIO software.

BID token (COART system token) will allow access to all payment and infrastructure utilities of the COART ecosystem. The
BID token uses smart-contracts to keep a trustless system in place, allowing exchange of rights to di erent artworks by investors and sale of artworks. We make it essentially easier to buy art, trade art and sell art (without the liquidity problem of having to wait for the artwork to go to auction a second time and the provenance problem of tracing the artwork’s origins). This is why we use blockchain technology for identification and tokenization of art- assets as means of investment and trade.
